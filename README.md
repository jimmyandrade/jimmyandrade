### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jimmy Andrade. My pronouns are they/them. But you can use he/him as well.

I'm a Design Systems Engineer / Front-End Engineer.

I also contributo some open-source projects like Storybook, GitHub and Commitizen.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects that use React, TypeScript, Styled Components, Storybook, Jest, RTL and Cypress;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Design Systems development with Radix and Tailwind;
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: contato@jimmyandrade.com;
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Design Systems, Storybook and... Music Production;
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've created some characters with outstanding voices, and I like to act and sing.
